			<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<hr>
			<h2>The Beginning of us</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left; line-height:2;">Our story began in September 2010 during our sophomore year at UCSD in La Jolla, CA. Jiaao lived downstairs from Josephine and met after a mutual friend (Vinny!) introduced them. Josephine thought their first meeting would be their last as Jiaao refused to look up from his Starcraft match during the brief meeting, but throughout the rest of the year they became good friends. Josephine slowly weened Jiaao off of his video game addition encouraging him to come over to watch Laker games, go to campus events, and to play poker. A year later in 2011 after downing some liquid courage Jiaao asked Josephine out. After 7 years of dating, Jiaao popped the question in Venice, Italy!</p>

			<h1>Things to Do</h1>
			<h2>Castle Rock State Park</h2>
			<p>15000 Skyline Blvd, Los Gatos, CA 95033, USA</p>
			<img src="Castle Rock State Park.PNG" style="width:100%"></img>
			<p style="text-align: left">We love Castle Rock State Park. There are are a variety of hiking trails ranging from short 1 mile loops to longer 16 mile hikes. Lots of people go bouldering and do roped climbs here.</p>
			<br></br>
			<h2>Big Basin Redwoods State Park headquarters & visitor center</h2>
			<p>21600 Big Basin Hwy, Boulder Creek, CA 95006, USA</p>
			<img src="Big Basin Redwoods State Park.jpg" style="width:100%"></img>
			<p style="text-align: left">Big Basin Redwoods State Park is another favorite of ours. This one is a little more difficult to get to (lots of twists/turns and narrow 2 way roads). They have a variety of hikes ranging from a super short 0.5 mile trail next to the parking lot to a 10.5 mile hike (with a waterfall!).</p>
			<br></br>
			<h2>Napa Valley, CA, USA</h2>
			<img src="Napa.jpg" style="width:100%"></img>
			<p style="text-align: left">You're in Norcal so you should definitely visit Napa Valley! Napa is a short 2 hour drive away! If you are planning a day trip to the Wine Country we recommend taking the 101 North so you can make a short stop to take pics at the Golden Gate Bridge (there's no toll going North). Some of our favorite places in the Napa area:</p>
			<br></br>
			<h2>Apple park visitor center</h2>
			<p>10600 N Tantau Ave, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA</p>
			<img src="Apple Visitors Center.jpg" style="width:100%"></img>
			<p style="text-align: left">The Apple Spaceship ! There's a giant Apple Store, a rooftop terrace, and even a cafe.</p>
			<br></br>
			<h2>Winchester Mystery House</h2>
			<p>525 S Winchester Blvd, San Jose, CA 95128, USA</p>
			<img src="Winchester Mystery House.jpg" style="width:100%"></img>
			<p style="text-align: left">Take a tour of the Winchester Mystery House. The Winchester Mystery House was home to Sarah Winchester the heiress of the Winchester Firearms fortune. Haunted by the spirits of Winchester rifle victims she built the Victorian Mansion with many odd and mysterious features.</p>
			<br></br>
			<h2>NASA AMES research center</h2>
			<p>Moffett Blvd, Mountain View, CA 94035, USA</p>
			<img src="NASA AMES visitors center.jpg" style="width:100%"></img>
			<p style="text-align: left">For all the space nerds like me there's a small visitors center housed in a tent at the NASA Ames Research Center. Best part - it's free !</p>
			<br></br>
			<h2>Lick Observatory</h2>
			<p>7281 Mt Hamilton Rd, Mt Hamilton, CA 95140, USA</p>
			<img src="Lick Observatory.jpg" style="width:100%"></img>
			<p style="text-align: left">Lick Observatory is way up on Mt Hamilton. Besides the great view, it is also high enough so that there is no light pollution to look at the stars!</p>
			<br></br>
			<h2>Lake Tahoe</h2>
			<p>Lake Tahoe, United States</p>
			<img src="Lake Tahoe.jpg" style="width:100%"></img>
			<p style="text-align: left">Lake Tahoe is a bit far at a 4 hour drive from the south bay, but well worth the trip. If there isn't snow yet, they have various hiking trails, as well as things you can do on the lake. Otherwise, skiing is one of our favorite activities!</p>
